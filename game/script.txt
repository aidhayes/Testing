    "Zarik's conquests in Solton and Nyqual made him a living legend in Thal. He quickly rose to the rank of General, and commanded the army of Pangual, his home province. Though Zarik's conquests didn't stop on the battlefield."
    "In the year 143 of the Thalan calendar, Zarik ursurped Dyton as Emperor of Thal. His charisma had garnered him the support of the entire army, so his rise to power was met with little resistance. Indeed, even the Thalan people loved Emperor Zarik"

I was still in contact with your mother, and after seeing what horrible things he was doing, I had her flee to an isolated location. He only just recently somehow found out he had a son. If you are reading this now, it means your father has imprisoned me. I assume he plans to torture me to find out where you are. I do not plan on telling them, but please, take your mother and run.
