    pov "Who said that?"
    anon "Up here, man."

    pov "Oh..."
    pov "Are you the one that wrote the letter?"
    anon "I'm your guy."
    pov "What the hell was that about? 'I've had my eye on you'? That's fucking creepy, man."
    anon "Relax dude, it's not like that."
    pov "Then what the hell is it like?"
    anon "Ugh... fine, yes, I've been watching you, but only for, like, five days maybe?"
    pov "FIVE DAYS???"
    anon "Yeah, I had to be sure you were the right guy."
    pov "Right guy?"
    anon "Yea, I'll have to explain later, but the fact you knew what weeping willow means I was right!"
    pov "Wait... what do you mean?"
    anon "You found me here, I never told you which weeping willow it was."
    pov "Oh... I guess I just found my way here instinctively."
    anon "See, instincts man, you got em!"
    pov "You think so... wait, no, who the hell are you?"
    anon "Oops, my bad, I guess I never introduced myself ♥"

    pov "Finally?"
    r "I've heard so much about you from your uncle."
    pov "You know my uncle?"
    r "Yeah me and Teach go way back. Hes taught me everything I've ever known."
    pov "Really?"
    r "Oh fuck yea, he's helped me a lot through the years, well anyway, he wanted me to find you."
    pov "What for? Will I get to see him, I haven't seen him in ages."
    r "About that..."
    r "He was made prisoner by the Emperor."
    pov "What the hell does the Emperor want with my uncle?"

    r "Hm?"
    pov "My dad is the Emperor???"
    r "Mhm."
    pov "There's no fucking way..."

    "Reyl hands you a note written in your uncle's handwriting."
    centered "[povname], I'm sorry for not telling you sooner, perhaps it wouldn't have turned out like this. What Reyl tells you is true, your father is Emperor Zarik. He left your mother before he ever knew she was pregnant, in between the time he left and you were born, he became Emperor. I was still in contact with your mother, and after seeing what horrible things he was doing, I had her flee to an isolated location. He only just recently somehow found out he had a son. If you are reading this now, it means your father has imprisoned me, I assume he plans to torture me to find out where you are. I do not plan on telling them, but please, take your mother and run. As far away as possible. I'm sorry [povname], I've always loved you as a son, if only we were dealt a better fate."
    "You drop to your knees and a wave of emotions hits you."
    r "Welp, you heard... no read... the man. Go get your mom and run."
    pov "I can't..."
    r "Don't be such a fucking pussy man, I mean, how are you gonna be such a pussy you can't even do the pussiest thing a man could do when faced with hardship?"
    pov "No..."
    r "Hm?"
    pov "I can't leave him behind..."
    r "Who? A friend?"
    pov "No dipshit."
    "You rise to your feet."
    pov "Theres no way in hell I'm gonna run away and leave my uncle behind."
    r "Oh?"
    r "Well this is most unexpected..."
    r "But not really though ♥. I was expecting this outcome all along."
    pov "But..."
    r "Hey man, that letter is just what your uncle wants you to do. I knew any sensible man wouldn't leave his family behind."
    r "Well, some of the stuff I've seen you do isn't so sensible. Going telegram club to talk to women... pathetic."
    pov "How the hell did you know that?"
    r "I've kept my eye on you, remember?"
    pov "Right... creep."
    r "We can settle that later, right now we need to get your mom to a safe location."
    pov "Right... just because I'm not running doesn't mean she has to stay with me."
    r "Exactly, let's go!"
